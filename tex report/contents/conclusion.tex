\section{Areas of Future Work}
\subsection{General Knowledge Gaps}
\begin{itemize}
    \item quantify accuracy of OmniWaterMask
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Suggested Further Development}
\begin{itemize}
    \item NALIRA
    \begin{itemize}
        \item higher resolution satellite compatibility
        \item code efficiency optimisations (IO handling, multithreading, caching - could talk about CPU and GPU (they are in the nomenclature))
        \item proper index thresholds
        \item image compositing for adaptation to months with more cloud cover
        \item actual cloud masking
        \item switch to pandas from just writing all the damn data handling yourself you thick moron
    \end{itemize}
    \item KRISP and KRISP Trainer
    \begin{itemize}
        \item sensitivity analysis on optimal number of epochs
        \item image composites
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Wider Applications}
\subsection{Environmental: Support Policy Decision-Making}
\begin{itemize}
    \item This research has the potential to inform water infrastructure LCA, aiding in the optimisation of resource management strategies. 
    \item It can also support the planning of renewable energy projects by providing reliable water data for cooling and thermal storage in low carbon heating networks. 
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Biology: Zebrafish Angiogenesis Study}
