# Masks Directory
This directory is built to contain all the masking information requested by NALIRA (data-labelling portion of IPDMP). The example files shown below are the exact files used 

add all your masking files here. if the program does not find the masking file, or if it is in the wrong format, that characteristic will not be masked. 

## Boundaries

## Known Reservoirs

## Rivers

## Urban Areas

## Special Cases
There are two other forms of masking that should be discussed; cloud masking and masking of terrain with high slope. 

### Clouds
Cloud masking is properly implemented in IPDMP, however there is no need for the user to place any specific files in any specific directory. 

### Terrain
