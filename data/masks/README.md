# Masks Directory
This directory is built to contain all the masking information requested by NALIRA (data-labelling portion of IPDMP). The example file names shown below are the exact files used in the development of the program. Currently, these are the only files compatible with NALIRA, however in future, this will be more flexible. 

## Boundaries
- **File Source**: [UK GOV](https://www.data.gov.uk/dataset/2e17269d-10b9-4e43-b67b-57f9b02bd0f8/countries-december-2021-boundaries-uk-buc)
- **File Type**: Single Geographic JavaScript Objection Notation (`.geojson`) file
- **File Path**: `boundaries` -> `Regions_December_2024_Boundaries_EN_BSC-PLACEHOLDER.geojson`

To restrict study to one country, we can use a BSC (Boundary, Super-Resolution, Clipped) `.geojson` file which contains information about the outline of England. This has the significant added benefit of masking out the sea as well. The sea can make up a large part of a satellite image, and since there are often clouds covering parts of the sea as well, small segments can be confused with reservoirs. 

## Known Reservoirs
- **File Source**: [UK GOV](https://www.data.gov.uk/dataset/aa1e16e8-eded-4a60-8d1d-0df920c319b6/inventory-of-reservoirs-amounting-to-90-of-total-uk-storage)
- **File Type**: Shapefile (`.shp`)
- **Folder Path**: `known_reservoirs` -> `LRR_EW_202307_v1` -> `SHP` -> `LRR_ENG_20230601_OSGB36.shp`

## Rivers and Streams
- **File Source**: [Ordnance Survey](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/products/os-open-rivers)
- **File Type**: Shapefile (`.shp`)
- **Folder Path**: `rivers` -> `data` -> `HydroNode.shp`

This data is given as points in this shapefile, which means that each point that shows a river is only 1 pixel. Therefore, for this masking, a buffer width of 10m is applied, which ensures that almost all rivers and streams are completely masked out. There are, of coure, larger rivers that are not entirely masked, but there is still a streak down the middle of the river that makes it obvious where the river is. 

## Urban Areas
- **File Source**: [UK CEH](https://catalogue.ceh.ac.uk/documents/5af9e97d-9f33-495d-8323-e57734388533?_gl=1*4k1tkl*_ga*NTgzNDcxODg0LjE3NTUwOTY2NjE.*_ga_27CMQ4NHKV*czE3NTUwOTY2NjEkbzEkZzAkdDE3NTUwOTY2NjEkajYwJGwwJGgw)
- **File Type**: Tagged Image Format `.tif` file in a `data` folder in a main folder
- **Folder Name**: `urban_areas` -> `CEH_GBLandCover_2024_10m` -> `data` -> `PLACEHOLDER` -> `gblcm2024_10m.tif`

The main folder also contains a supporting documents folder, a `.DS_Store` file, and a `readme.html` file. This data seems to mask out some known reservoirs as well. This is a known issue. This is also the least widely accessible data.

## High-Slope Terrain (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET)
- **File Source**: [UK GOV](https://environment.data.gov.uk/dataset/13787b9a-26a4-4775-8523-806d13af58fc) or [Ordnance Survey](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/products/os-terrain-50#get)
- **File Type**: `.zip` folder in a sub-folder in a `data` folder in a folder
- **Folder Name**: `terrain` -> `terr_50_cesh_gb` -> `data` -> e.g. `hp` -> `hp40_OST50CONT_2025_0529.zip`

Implementation of high-slope area masking is planned, but not complete yet.

## Special Case (Clouds)
Cloud masking is already implemented in IPDMP, however there is no need for the user to place any specific files in any specific directory. IPDMP uses the [OmniCloudMask](https://github.com/DPIRD-DMA/OmniCloudMask) Python library (can be installed and found hosted on GitHub), which is a deep learning solution to cloud and cloud shadow segmentation.
