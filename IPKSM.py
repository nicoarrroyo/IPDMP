""" Individual Project Keras Sequential Model (IPKSM)

Description:
This tutorial shows how to classify images of flowers using a 
`tf.keras.Sequential` model and load data using 
`tf.keras.utils.image_dataset_from_directory`. It demonstrates the following 
concepts:

* Efficiently loading a dataset off disk.
* Identifying overfitting and applying techniques to mitigate it, including 
data augmentation and dropout.

This tutorial follows a basic machine learning workflow:

1. Examine and understand data
2. Build an input pipeline
3. Build the model
4. Train the model
5. Test the model
6. Improve the model and repeat the process

In addition, the notebook demonstrates how to convert a [saved model] 
(../../../guide/saved_model.ipynb) to a [TensorFlow Lite] 
(https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/) model for on-device machine learning on 
mobile, embedded, and IoT devices.

There are two datasets intended for the training of two models. Each is made 
up of about 1,300 photos of either water reservoirs, or non-reservoir water 
bodies. The two datasets exist to train one model on Normalised Difference 
Water Index (NDWI) images, while the other will be trained on True Colour 
Images (TCI). In each of these folders, there will be two sub-directories, one 
per class:

```
ndwi/
  reservoirs/
  water bodies/
```
```
tci/
  reservoirs/
  water bodies/
```

Next, load these images off disk using the helpful 
`tf.keras.utils.image_dataset_from_directory` utility. This will take you from 
a directory of images on disk to a `tf.data.Dataset` in just a couple lines of 
code.

Define some parameters for the loader:
"""

batch_size = 32
img_height = 157
img_width = 157
validation_split = 0.2

"""It's good practice to use a validation split when developing your model. 
Use 80% of the images for training and 20% for validation."""

train_ds = tf.keras.utils.image_dataset_from_directory(
  data_dir,
  validation_split=validation_split,
  subset="training",
  seed=123,
  image_size=(img_height, img_width),
  batch_size=batch_size)

val_ds = tf.keras.utils.image_dataset_from_directory(
  data_dir,
  validation_split=validation_split,
  subset="validation",
  seed=123,
  image_size=(img_height, img_width),
  batch_size=batch_size)

class_names = train_ds.class_names

"""
You will pass these datasets to the Keras `Model.fit` method for training 
later in this tutorial. If you like, you can also manually iterate over the 
dataset and retrieve batches of images.

The `image_batch` is a tensor of the shape `(32, 180, 180, 3)`. This is a 
batch of 32 images of shape `180x180x3` (the last dimension refers to color 
channels RGB). The `label_batch` is a tensor of the shape `(32,)`, these are 
corresponding labels to the 32 images.

You can call `.numpy()` on the `image_batch` and `labels_batch` tensors to 
convert them to a `numpy.ndarray`.
"""

# %%% Configure the dataset for performance
"""
AUTOTUNE tells TensorFlow to automatically optimize parallelism.
cache() loads data into memory for faster access.
shuffle() randomizes the training data order.
prefetch() loads the next data batch while the current one is being processed.
This combination prevents data loading from becoming a bottleneck during 
training.
"""

AUTOTUNE = tf.data.AUTOTUNE

train_ds = train_ds.cache().shuffle(1000).prefetch(buffer_size=AUTOTUNE)
val_ds = val_ds.cache().prefetch(buffer_size=AUTOTUNE)

# %% Improvements
# %%% Overfitting

"""
With a basic model, the training accuracy is increasing linearly over time, 
whereas validation accuracy stalls around 60% in the training process. Also, 
the difference in accuracy between training and validation accuracy is 
noticeable - a sign of [overfitting] 
(https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/overfit_and_underfit).

When there are a small number of training examples, the model sometimes learns 
from noises or unwanted details from training examplesâ€”to an extent that it 
negatively impacts the performance of the model on new examples. This 
phenomenon is known as overfitting. It means that the model will have a 
difficult time generalizing on a new dataset.

There are multiple ways to fight overfitting in the training process. In this 
tutorial, you'll use *data augmentation* and add *dropout* to your model.
"""
# %%% Data augmentation

"""
Overfitting generally occurs when there are a small number of training 
examples. Data augmentation takes the approach of generating additional 
training data from your existing examples by augmenting them using random 
transformations that yield believable-looking images. This helps expose the 
model to more aspects of the data and generalize better.

You will implement data augmentation using the following Keras preprocessing 
layers: `tf.keras.layers.RandomFlip`, `tf.keras.layers.RandomRotation`, and 
`tf.keras.layers.RandomZoom`. These can be included inside your model like 
other layers, and run on the GPU. You will add data augmentation to your 
model before training in the next step.
"""

data_augmentation = keras.Sequential(
  [
    layers.RandomFlip("horizontal", input_shape=(img_height, img_width, 3)),
    layers.RandomRotation(0.1),
    layers.RandomZoom(0.1),
  ]
)

# %%% Dropout

"""
Another technique to reduce overfitting is to introduce [dropout] 
(https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#dropout_regularization) 
 regularization to the network.

When you apply dropout to a layer, it randomly drops out (by setting the 
activation to zero) a number of output units from the layer during the 
training process. Dropout takes a fractional number as its input value, in the 
form such as 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, etc. This means dropping out 10%, 20% or 40% of 
the output units randomly from the applied layer.

Create a new neural network with `tf.keras.layers.Dropout` before training it 
using the augmented images:
"""

# %% Create the Model
num_classes = len(class_names)

model = Sequential([
  data_augmentation,
  layers.Rescaling(1./255),
  layers.Conv2D(16, 3, padding='same', activation='relu'),
  layers.MaxPooling2D(),
  layers.Conv2D(32, 3, padding='same', activation='relu'),
  layers.MaxPooling2D(),
  layers.Conv2D(64, 3, padding='same', activation='relu'),
  layers.MaxPooling2D(),
  layers.Dropout(0.2),
  layers.Flatten(),
  layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
  layers.Dense(num_classes, name="outputs")

# %%% Compile and train the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss=tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(
                  from_logits=True),
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# model.summary()

history = model.fit(
  train_ds,
  validation_data=val_ds,
  epochs=epochs_keras_new
)

# %%% Visualize training results
"""
After applying data augmentation and `tf.keras.layers.Dropout`, there is less 
overfitting than before, and training and validation accuracy are closer 
aligned:
"""

acc = history.history['accuracy']
val_acc = history.history['val_accuracy']

loss = history.history['loss']
val_loss = history.history['val_loss']
